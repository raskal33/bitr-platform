Rule 1: Project Structure Understanding
This is a decentralized prediction market platform with the following structure:
- `backend/`: Node.js API server, indexers, oracle services, and database management
- `solidity/`: Smart contracts (BitredictPool, Oddyssey, Oracle contracts) and deployment scripts
- `docs/`: Docusaurus documentation site
- `bot/`: Oracle and automation bots
- `scripts/`: Utility and maintenance scripts
- Frontend is in a separate directory: `/home/leon/predict-linux`

Rule 2: Key Technologies
- Blockchain: Somnia EVM network
- Backend: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL (Neon.tech), Redis
- Smart Contracts: Solidity ^0.8.20 with Hardhat
- Frontend: React/Next.js (separate directory)
- Documentation: Docusaurus with TypeScript

Rule 3: Database Architecture
The system uses a 4-schema PostgreSQL design:
- Core: Users, reputation, achievements
- Oracle: Match data, crypto prices, external APIs
- Prediction: Pools, bets, liquidity provision
- Oddyssey: Daily games, slips, leaderboards
