Rule 1: Code Organization
- Keep backend services modular and well-documented
- Use consistent naming conventions across all components
- Separate concerns: API, indexers, oracle services, database
- Maintain clear separation between blockchain and backend logic

Rule 2: Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling in all API endpoints
- Use try-catch blocks for database operations
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

Rule 3: Performance Optimization
- Use database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement caching strategies for external API calls
- Optimize blockchain event indexing with proper filtering
- Use connection pooling for database connections

Rule 4: Security Best Practices
- Never expose private keys in code or logs
- Validate all user inputs and API parameters
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
