Rule 1: Development Environment Setup
- Backend runs on localhost, production database on neon.tech
- Use MCP to connect to the database for queries and migrations
- Frontend is in separate directory: `/home/leon/predict-linux`
- Use `npm run lint` and `npx tsc` for frontend validation instead of full build

Rule 2: Testing and Validation
- Run `npm run lint` for frontend code quality checks
- Use `npx tsc` for TypeScript compilation checks
- Test backend with `npm run backend:dev` for development
- Use `npm run test` in solidity directory for contract testing

Rule 3: Database Operations
- Use MCP tools for database queries and migrations
- Always test migrations on temporary branches first
- Use `prepare_database_migration` for schema changes
- Verify changes before applying to main branch

Rule 4: Smart Contract Development
- Compile contracts with `cd solidity && npx hardhat compile`
- Test contracts with `cd solidity && npx hardhat test`
- Deploy with Hardhat Ignition modules
- Use `npm run deploy:somnia` for production deployment
