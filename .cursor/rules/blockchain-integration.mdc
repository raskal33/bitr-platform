Rule 1: Smart Contract Development
- Follow Solidity best practices and security patterns
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts for standard functionality
- Implement proper access control and modifiers
- Test thoroughly with comprehensive test suites

Rule 2: Event Indexing
- Index all important contract events for off-chain processing
- Use proper event filtering to reduce unnecessary data
- Handle blockchain reorganizations gracefully
- Implement retry logic for failed indexing operations

Rule 3: Oracle Integration
- Implement proper validation for oracle data sources
- Use multiple data sources for critical outcomes
- Handle oracle failures with fallback mechanisms
- Implement proper bonding and challenge mechanisms

Rule 4: Gas Optimization
- Optimize contract functions for gas efficiency
- Use batch operations where possible
- Implement proper storage patterns
- Monitor gas costs in production deployments

Rule 5: Things to know:
