## üìä Reputation Calculation

### Score Dynamics

```
Current Reputation = Base Score (40) + Œ£(Positive Actions) - Œ£(Negative Actions)

Example User Journey:
Starting: 40 points (Elementary)
+ Creates 5 successful pools (+0, but +8 each for >60% fill): +40 points
+ Wins 10 high-value bets: +50 points  
+ Successfully challenges 2 incorrect outcomes: +20 points
- Makes 1 incorrect proposal: -12 points
= Final Score: 40 + 40 + 50 + 20 - 12 = 138 points (Trusted)
```

### Reputation Decay

**No natural decay** - reputation only changes through actions:
- Scores don't decrease over time through inactivity
- Past achievements are permanently recorded
- Only negative actions can reduce reputation
- System encourages consistent quality over time

### Score Recovery

**Redemption through good behavior:**
- Users can recover from negative actions
- No permanent blacklisting for most violations
- Progressive improvement encouraged
- Appeals process for disputed penalties
