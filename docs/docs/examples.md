# Pool Examples & Scenarios

Understanding Bitredict's contrarian pool structure is easier with concrete examples. Here are real scenarios showing how different outcomes affect all participants.

## üèÜ Example 1: Football Match Pool

### Pool Setup
```
üéØ Pool: "Liverpool beats Arsenal" 
Creator: Sarah (thinks Liverpool WON'T win)
Sarah's contrarian bet: 200 STT against Liverpool winning
Odds set: 2.0x
Maximum bets allowed: 100 STT total

üìä Participants:
- Sarah (Creator): 200 STT AGAINST Liverpool
- Mike (LP): 100 STT AGAINST Liverpool (joins Sarah's side)  
- Tom (Bettor): 60 STT FOR Liverpool winning
- Lisa (Bettor): 40 STT FOR Liverpool winning

üí∞ Total Pool: 400 STT
- Against Liverpool: 300 STT (Sarah: 200 + Mike: 100)
- For Liverpool: 100 STT (Tom: 60 + Lisa: 40)
```

### Scenario A: Liverpool Wins 2-1

**Result**: Predicted outcome happened ‚Üí Bettors win, Creator/LP lose

**Payouts:**
- **Tom gets**: 60 √ó 2.0 = 120 STT (minus 5% platform fee = 114 STT)
- **Lisa gets**: 40 √ó 2.0 = 80 STT (minus 5% platform fee = 76 STT)  
- **Sarah loses**: All 200 STT
- **Mike loses**: All 100 STT

**Total winnings**: Bettors get 190 STT, Platform gets 10 STT fee

### Scenario B: Arsenal Wins 1-0

**Result**: Predicted outcome didn't happen ‚Üí Creator/LP win, Bettors lose

**Payouts:**
- **Sarah gets**: 200 STT back + (100 √ó 200/300) = 266.67 STT
- **Mike gets**: 100 STT back + (100 √ó 100/300) = 133.33 STT
- **Tom loses**: All 60 STT  
- **Lisa loses**: All 40 STT

**Total winnings**: Creator/LP split the 100 STT from bettors proportionally

## üí∞ Example 2: Crypto Price Pool

### Pool Setup
```
ü™ô Pool: "Bitcoin reaches $120,000 by Dec 31, 2024"
Creator: Alex (thinks BTC WON'T reach $120k)
Alex's contrarian bet: 500 STT against BTC hitting $120k
Odds set: 4.0x (very confident it won't happen)
Maximum bets allowed: 166 STT total

üìä Participants:
- Alex (Creator): 500 STT AGAINST BTC reaching $120k
- Emma (Bettor): 100 STT FOR BTC reaching $120k  
- David (Bettor): 66 STT FOR BTC reaching $120k

üí∞ Total Pool: 666 STT
- Against BTC $120k: 500 STT (Alex only)
- For BTC $120k: 166 STT (Emma: 100 + David: 66)
```

### Scenario A: Bitcoin Hits $125,000

**Result**: Predicted outcome happened ‚Üí Bettors win big

**Payouts:**
- **Emma gets**: 100 √ó 4.0 = 400 STT (minus 5% fee = 380 STT)
- **David gets**: 66 √ó 4.0 = 264 STT (minus 5% fee = 250.8 STT)
- **Alex loses**: All 500 STT

**Alex's lesson**: Being overconfident with 4.0x odds was risky!

### Scenario B: Bitcoin Peaks at $118,000

**Result**: Predicted outcome didn't happen ‚Üí Creator wins big  

**Payouts:**
- **Alex gets**: 500 STT back + 166 STT from bettors = 666 STT
- **Emma loses**: All 100 STT
- **David loses**: All 66 STT

**Alex's reward**: 33% return for correctly predicting market wouldn't reach $120k

## üéÆ Example 3: Custom Event Pool

### Pool Setup
```
üì∫ Pool: "Netflix announces gaming console at CES 2025"

- **Rachel gets**: 300 STT back + 75 STT = 375 STT

## üßÆ Quick Math Reference

### Calculating Maximum Bets
```
Max Bets = Creator Stake √∑ (Odds - 1)

Examples:
- 100 STT at 2.0x odds = 100 √∑ 1 = 100 STT max bets
- 100 STT at 3.0x odds = 100 √∑ 2 = 50 STT max bets  
- 100 STT at 5.0x odds = 100 √∑ 4 = 25 STT max bets
```

### Calculating Payouts
```
Bettor Payout = Bet Amount √ó Odds (minus platform fee)
Creator Share = Original Stake + (Lost Bets √ó Share Percentage)

Share Percentage = Your Stake √∑ Total Creator Side Stake
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### For New Users
1. **Start small**: Begin with 10-20 STT pools to learn the mechanics
2. **Watch others**: Observe successful creators' strategies  
3. **Focus on familiar areas**: Bet on sports/topics you understand
4. **Read the odds**: Higher odds mean creator is very confident

### For Experienced Users  
1. **Diversify**: Create multiple smaller pools rather than one large pool
2. **Track record matters**: Build reputation for attracting more bettors
3. **Time your entries**: Early bets often get better effective odds
4. **Use combos wisely**: Multi-condition pools are high risk/reward
