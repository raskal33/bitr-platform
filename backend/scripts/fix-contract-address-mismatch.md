# Contract Address Mismatch Analysis & Solution

## 🚨 **Critical Issue Identified**

The guided football market creation is failing because of a **contract address mismatch** between frontend and backend.

### **Current State:**
- **Frontend Contract Address**: `0x5a66a41b884aF70d5671b322C3e6ac1346CC885C` (OLD/DEAD)
- **Backend Contract Address**: `0x6C9DCB0F967fbAc62eA82d99BEF8870b4272919a` (ACTIVE)
- **Active Contract Pool Count**: 2 pools
- **Database Pools**: 0 pools (correctly empty since transactions failed)

### **Transaction Analysis:**
- **Transaction Hash**: `0xb85fda328ccad2cd12a9df32144e927bb5ec7632b59a610180acae7ebfac5732`
- **Status**: ❌ **FAILED**
- **Gas Used**: 564,172 (out of 1,950,000)
- **Reason**: Transaction sent to non-existent or replaced contract

## 🔧 **Immediate Fixes Required**

### 1. **Update Frontend Contract Address**
The frontend needs to be updated to use the correct contract address:
```javascript
// OLD (frontend)
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x5a66a41b884aF70d5671b322C3e6ac1346CC885C';

// NEW (should be)
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x6C9DCB0F967fbAc62eA82d99BEF8870b4272919a';
```

### 2. **Verify Contract Deployment**
Check if the new contract is properly deployed and accessible:
- ✅ Contract responds to `poolCount()` call
- ✅ Contract has 2 existing pools
- ✅ Contract ABI is compatible

### 3. **Update Environment Variables**
Ensure all services use the same contract address:
```env
# Backend config.js (already correct)
BITREDIT_POOL_ADDRESS=0x6C9DCB0F967fbAc62eA82d99BEF8870b4272919a

# Frontend .env (needs update)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x6C9DCB0F967fbAc62eA82d99BEF8870b4272919a
```

## 📋 **Files That Need Updates**

### Frontend Files (in `/predict-linux`):
1. **Environment Variables**: `.env.local` or `.env`
2. **Contract Configuration**: Any hardcoded contract addresses
3. **Web3 Configuration**: Contract initialization files
4. **Market Creation Components**: Ensure they use the correct address

### Backend Files (already correct):
- ✅ `backend/config.js` - Uses correct address
- ✅ `backend/indexer.js` - Uses correct address
- ✅ `backend/services/` - All use correct address

## 🎯 **Validation Steps**

### 1. **Test Contract Accessibility**
```bash
# Test the active contract
node -e "
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/');
const contract = new ethers.Contract('0x6C9DCB0F967fbAc62eA82d99BEF8870b4272919a', ['function poolCount() view returns (uint256)'], provider);
contract.poolCount().then(count => console.log('Active pools:', count.toString()));
"
```

### 2. **Test Market Creation**
After updating frontend, test creating a new market to ensure it works.

### 3. **Verify Indexing**
Check that new markets are properly indexed and appear in the database.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate**: Update frontend contract address
2. **Test**: Create a new guided football market
3. **Verify**: Check that the market appears in the UI
4. **Monitor**: Ensure the indexer processes new markets correctly

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix**

- ✅ Market creation transactions will succeed
- ✅ Pools will be created on the active contract
- ✅ Indexer will process and save pools to database
- ✅ Markets will appear in the frontend UI
- ✅ All guided market functionality will work correctly

## 🔍 **Root Cause Summary**

The system architecture is correct, but the frontend was not updated when the contract was redeployed. This is a common issue in blockchain development when contracts are upgraded or redeployed.

**The fix is simple**: Update the frontend to use the correct contract address, and everything should work as expected.
