# Oddyssey Contract Review Checklist

## üîç Pre-Deployment Review

### 1. Contract State Analysis
- [ ] Check current contract state
- [ ] Verify oracle address is correct
- [ ] Check if any cycles need resolution
- [ ] Verify contract permissions

### 2. Contract Code Review
- [ ] Review cycle creation logic
- [ ] Check match result handling
- [ ] Verify prize distribution logic
- [ ] Check emergency functions

### 3. Integration Points
- [ ] Verify backend can create cycles
- [ ] Check result resolution process
- [ ] Test oracle permissions
- [ ] Verify event emission

## üöÄ Fresh Start Plan

### Option A: Keep Current Contract
- [ ] Resolve any pending cycles
- [ ] Reset cycle counter if possible
- [ ] Update backend to start from cycle 1

### Option B: Deploy New Contract (Recommended)
- [ ] Deploy fresh contract
- [ ] Update contract address in backend
- [ ] Set up oracle permissions
- [ ] Test cycle creation

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### 1. Contract Deployment
- [ ] Deploy contract to testnet first
- [ ] Test cycle creation
- [ ] Test result resolution
- [ ] Deploy to mainnet

### 2. Backend Updates
- [ ] Update contract address
- [ ] Test cycle creation
- [ ] Test match selection
- [ ] Test result resolution

### 3. Database Reset
- [ ] Run schema fixes
- [ ] Clear existing cycles
- [ ] Reset sequences
- [ ] Verify clean state

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

1. **Run schema fixes** on production database
2. **Deploy fresh contract** to avoid legacy issues
3. **Update backend** with new contract address
4. **Test complete flow** from cycle creation to resolution
5. **Monitor for 24 hours** to ensure stability

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations

- **Oracle Address**: Ensure backend wallet is set as oracle
- **Cycle Timing**: Verify 1-day cycle logic is correct
- **Match Selection**: Ensure 10 matches per cycle
- **Result Resolution**: Test automatic resolution process
- **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for edge cases
